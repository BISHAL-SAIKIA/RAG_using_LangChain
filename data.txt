Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks. The learning process is deep because the structure of artificial neural networks consists of multiple input, output, and hidden layers.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that combines information retrieval with text generation. It retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and uses them to generate more accurate and contextual responses.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep learning models trained on massive amounts of text data. They can understand and generate human-like text, perform various language tasks, and are the foundation of modern AI applications like ChatGPT and Claude.

Vector databases store data as high-dimensional vectors, which are mathematical representations of data features. They enable efficient similarity search and are essential for AI applications like semantic search and recommendation systems.
